# Data Science Coursework 2

The name of the project: Heart Failure Analysis

This project focus on predicting the survival of patients who had heart failure based on 11 clinical features. We consider using 5 classification models, including Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and Random forest to make predictions. We aim to find the model with the best prediction accuracy and also we want to find the important features that can affect patients' survival.

## Data

This directory contains all raw and derived data sets. Further information can be found in [README for data folder](/01-data/README.md).

## Analyses

This directory contains all the R scripts to do the analyses, from data preprocessing to the modelling. Further information can be found in [README for analyses folder](/02-analyses/README.md).

## Results

This directory contains all the images from the R output and a final report. This report is produced based on the images and other model outputs from the analysis process.
